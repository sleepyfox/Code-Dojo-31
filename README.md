Code Dojo 28
============
This is my worked example from the 31st meeting of the London Code Dojo. Feel free to play around with it. I've used Node.js and CoffeeScript with the Mocha testing library and the Chai assertion library.

The tests can be run from the command-line with:
	
	npm test

The source of the kata is the idea of a Concordance, a listing of all the words that appear in a book together with the lines that they appear on. More on concordances and their history can be found on Wikipedia [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concordance_%28publishing%29)

To actually produce a concordance of the Magna Carta text (translation provided into modern English by the British Library) use the following command:

	coffee main.coffee magna_carta.txt
